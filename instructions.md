You are helping me to create prompts or guidelines for the AI to use to build a web app.

This web app is for SEO optimizing and Language nutralising.

This web app will be built with any combination of the following: php, javascript, css and html. You don't have to use all of them.

Please advise if this web app needs to connect to AI for the optimisation suggestions. If so, please also build a configuration page for the user to enter their API key.

The main interface will have:
- A text input field for the user to enter the text they want to optimize. User can paste text from clipboard or from a file.
- A button to submit the text.
- A section to display the optimisation suggestions for SEO.
- A section to display the language neutralisation suggestions.
- A text output field to display the optimized text.
- A button to copy the optimized text to the clipboard.

If the AI is used, please provide a configuration page for the user to enter their API key.
